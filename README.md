The provided code has been written in google colab, and would for that reson most easily be run that way. 
You will however need to correct the paths defined in the scripts to direct to your own folder.

When running the code you will have to run the data processing script first, thus generating the necesarry pickle files for the Ensemble-model-FACE-raw-spec-clip script.

We were not able to upload the custom datasets created for the project, and for that reason you cant run our code for the mixed dataset, but it works the same way as the other ensemble code for faces.
If you want the datasets, please contact us, and we will send you the necesarry files.
